# Continuation

## What do I need to do to get there? 
1. Parse the GPX files.  Break the segments into 100m pieces.
2. For each segment, calculate the elevation and speed.
3. Make enough buckets for all the elevations
4. For each elevation difference, increment by speed
5. Visualizations (d3)
5a. Create a scatterplot of elevation by speed
