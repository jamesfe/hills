# Objective

As part of planning a bike trip to Andorra in the fall, I hope to gather more information about how fast I can climb hills.  I've downloaded a bunch of GPX files into the /data/ directory.  I want to gather some data from previous rides.

## What do I want to know?
1. A scatterplot of 100m segments: slope(%) vs seconds to finish
2. The same scatterplot of 100m segments, different units: slope (%) vs miles per hour
3. Line graph: multiple lines, each one a range of slopes (0-2%, 2-4%, etc.) vs mph, graphed from 7AM to 7PM.

## What do I need to do to get there? 
1. Parse the GPX files.  Break the segments into 100m pieces.
2. For each segment, calculate the elevation and speed.
3. Bucket
